Base Challenge
--------------------------------
usage
	python ecdf.py --school "Port Chester University" input_file1.csv input_file2.csv
	
algorithm
	reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile#The_Nearest_Rank_method
	given scores[] (of students in a specific school) and percentile p,
	the percentile value (output) should be scores[ceil(p/100 * N)-1]
	i.e. 
	when p = 0   => output = 0
	when p = 100 => output = highest score among students

	
Bonus Challenge #1
--------------------------------
client-server model

usage
	python server.py --listen 12345 --school "Port Chester University" input_file1.csv input_file2.csv
	python client.py --get 127.0.0.1 12345 please send the Xth percentile to client Y
	
output
	client would print out what it got from server;
	server would log requests in the file request_history.log

note
	I deployed another RESTful solution by Django in directory RESTful.
	To test this, it requires to install django (and dependent lib as well).
	To start a server:
		python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8080
	To configure a server:
		change the list of inputs in config.ini
	to connect as a client:
		Use any modern web explorer (such as chrome, safari, ...etc) to connect to 127.0.0.1:8080.
		By giving input of client, school, and percentile, server will reply the corresponding answer and log the request.
	
	In case that django is not installed or configured in other environment, I put some demo image in directory/demo.
